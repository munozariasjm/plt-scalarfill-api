### How to run this API?
**Locally**


Since it is a Streamlit API, to deploy it locally is directly simple:
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone ...
```

Install the requirements (Notice that it is very important that you only manage requirements using 'pip', for the ends on direct hosting on streamlit service).
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, simply run:
```bash
streaamlit run Home.py
```

And this will run the API in your local host.

**Streamlit**


If you wish to deploy the app online, you can create a free account at [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and then simply link this repo.
